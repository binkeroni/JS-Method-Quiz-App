/**
 *
 * Technical requirements:
 *
 * Your app should include a render() function, that regenerates the view each time the store is updated.
 * See your course material, consult your instructor, and reference the slides for more details.
 *
 * NO additional HTML elements should be added to the index.html file.
 *
 * You may add attributes (classes, ids, etc) to the existing HTML elements, or link stylesheets or additional scripts if necessary
 *
 * SEE BELOW FOR THE CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS YOU WILL BE CREATING ðŸ‘‡
